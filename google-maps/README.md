# cljsjs/google-maps

[](dependency)
```clojure
[cljsjs/google-maps "3.18-1"] ;; latest release
```
[](/dependency)

This jar comes with `deps.cljs` as used by the [Foreign Libs][flibs] feature
of the Clojurescript compiler.

The jar only provides an extern file required for advanced compilation.
The Google Maps js API will still need to provided through some other mechanism.
