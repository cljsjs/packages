This jar comes with `deps.cljs` as used by the [Foreign Libs][flibs] feature
of the Clojurescript compiler. After adding the above dependency to your project
you can require the packaged library like so:

```clojure
(ns application.core
  (:require cljsjs.auth0))
```

Documentation for the auth0 lib can be found [on its github page](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js)
