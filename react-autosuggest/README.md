This jar comes with `deps.cljs` as used by the [Foreign Libs][flibs] feature
of the ClojureScript compiler. After adding the above dependency to your project
you can require the packaged library like so:

```clojure
(ns application.core
  (:require cljsjs.react-autosuggest))
```

A sample reagent project that uses the library is available at [https://github.com/cdorrat/autosuggest-sample](https://github.com/cdorrat/autosuggest-sample)
