[cljsjs/youtube "1.0-0"] ;; latest release
```
[](/dependency)

This jar comes with `deps.cljs` as used by the [Foreign Libs][flibs] feature
of the ClojureScript compiler.

The jar only provides an extern file required for advanced compilation.
The YouTube JS will still need to be provided through some other mechanism.
