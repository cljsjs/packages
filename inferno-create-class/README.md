[](/dependency)

This jar comes with `deps.cljs` as used by the [Foreign Libs][flibs] feature
of the Clojurescript compiler.

https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-create-class
Note: this is similar to React.createClass in that methods are out-bound. However, this module does not support mixins.
