# cljsjs/stripe
[](dependency)
```clojure
[cljsjs/stripe "2.0-2"] ;; latest release
```
[](/dependency)

This jar comes with `deps.cljs` as used by the [Foreign Libs][flibs] feature
of the Clojurescript compiler.

The jar only provides an extern file required for advanced compilation.
The Stripe js API will still need to be provided through some other mechanism.
