This jar comes with `deps.cljs` as used by the [Foreign Libs][flibs] feature
of the ClojureScript compiler. After adding the above dependency to your project
you can require the packaged library like so:

```clojure
(ns application.core
  (:require [cljsjs.firebase]))
```

or for firebase-node:

```clojure
(ns application.core
  (:require [cljsjs.firebase-node]))
```

## Maintenance

Bump the version number in build.boot,
the source and externs are downloaded from npm.
