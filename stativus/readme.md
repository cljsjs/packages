[](/dependency)

Statecharts are a control mechanism; they augment or replace traditional controllers in the MVC architecture. The notation was originally devised by Harel. See [Stativus](http://stativ.us/) for more.

This jar comes with `deps.cljs` as used by the [Foreign Libs][flibs] feature
of the ClojureScript compiler. After adding the above dependency to your project
you can require the packaged library like so:

```clojure
(ns application.core
  (:require cljsjs.d3))
```
