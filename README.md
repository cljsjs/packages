# CLJSJS Packages

<img src="http://cljsjs.github.io/cljsjs.png" alt="CLJSJS logo" align="right" />

CLJSJS is an effort to package Javascript libraries to be able to use
them from within Clojurescript.

## Using these packages

All packages provided by [cljsjs][clojars-cljsjs] provide `deps.cljs`
files that will be automatically picked up by the Clojurescript
compiler as of [0.0-2727][2727]. Versions of the Jar reflect the
version of the packaged JS lib.

**You can find the specific coordinates for those packages in their
respective `README` files.**
